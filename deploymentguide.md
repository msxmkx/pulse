# ðŸš€ Deployment Guide for PULSE Financial Platform

## Render Deployment Setup

### Files Added for Render Deployment:

1. **`render.yaml`** - Render configuration file
2. **`requirements.txt`** - Updated with specific versions
3. **`Procfile`** - Alternative deployment configuration
4. **`.gitignore`** - Excludes unnecessary files
5. **Updated `app_monochrome.py`** - Production-ready configuration

### Step-by-Step Render Deployment:

#### 1. **Push Files to GitHub**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add deployment configuration for Render"
git push origin main
```

#### 2. **Connect to Render**
1. Go to [render.com](https://render.com)
2. Sign up/Login with your GitHub account
3. Click "New +" â†’ "Web Service"
4. Connect your GitHub repository
5. Select the repository containing PULSE

#### 3. **Configure the Web Service**
- **Name**: `pulse-financial-platform`
- **Environment**: `Python 3`
- **Build Command**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **Start Command**: `gunicorn app_monochrome:app`
- **Plan**: Free (or choose paid plan)

#### 4. **Environment Variables (Optional)**
Add these in Render dashboard if needed:
- `PORT`: 10000 (Render will set this automatically)
- `FLASK_ENV`: production

#### 5. **Deploy**
Click "Create Web Service" and wait for deployment.

## Alternative Deployment Options

### Heroku Deployment
If you prefer Heroku, the `Procfile` is already configured.

### Railway Deployment
Railway will automatically detect the Python app and use the requirements.txt.

### Vercel Deployment
For Vercel, you'll need to create a `vercel.json` file:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "app_monochrome.py",
      "use": "@vercel/python"
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "app_monochrome.py"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### 1. **Build Fails with "Exited with status 1"**
- Check that all files are committed to GitHub
- Verify `requirements.txt` has correct package versions
- Ensure `app_monochrome.py` is the main file

### 2. **Import Errors**
- Make sure all dependencies are in `requirements.txt`
- Check for typos in import statements

### 3. **Port Issues**
- The app now uses `os.environ.get('PORT', 8080)` for flexibility
- Render will automatically set the PORT environment variable

### 4. **Static Files Not Loading**
- All CSS/JS is loaded from CDN, so this shouldn't be an issue
- If using local files, add them to a `static/` folder

## File Structure for Deployment

```
PULSE-Financial-Platform/
â”œâ”€â”€ app_monochrome.py          # Main application (PRODUCTION)
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt           # Python dependencies
â”œâ”€â”€ render.yaml               # Render configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ Procfile                  # Alternative deployment config
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore               # Git ignore rules
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md                # Project documentation
â”œâ”€â”€ PROJECT_SUMMARY.md       # Complete project overview
â”œâ”€â”€ DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md      # This file
â”œâ”€â”€ app_final.py             # Alternative version
â”œâ”€â”€ app_futuristic.py        # Alternative version
â”œâ”€â”€ app_simple.py            # Alternative version
â””â”€â”€ app.py                   # Original version (deprecated)
```

## Production Considerations

### Security
- Debug mode is disabled in production
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Consider adding rate limiting for API endpoints

### Performance
- Gunicorn is configured for production
- Static assets are served from CDN
- Database integration can be added later

### Monitoring
- Render provides built-in logging
- Consider adding application monitoring
- Set up error tracking (Sentry, etc.)

## Quick Test Commands

### Local Testing
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run locally
python app_monochrome.py

# Test with gunicorn
gunicorn app_monochrome:app
```

### Production Testing
After deployment, test these endpoints:
- `/` - Homepage
- `/market-pulse` - Market Intelligence
- `/underrated-stocks` - Emerging Opportunities
- `/stocks-to-sell` - Risk Assessment
- `/portfolio` - Portfolio Management
- `/performance-comparison` - Performance Analytics

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check Render logs in the dashboard
2. Verify all files are in the repository
3. Test locally first
4. Check the requirements.txt versions
