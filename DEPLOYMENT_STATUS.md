# 🚀 PULSE Financial App - Deployment Status

## ✅ **Current Status: Testing Minimal Deployment**

I've created a minimal test app to isolate the deployment issue. Here's what's happening:

### 🔍 **Problem Identified**
The main `app_monochrome.py` file (77KB, 1689 lines) might be causing build issues on Render due to its complexity or dependencies.

### 🧪 **Solution: Minimal Test App**
I've created `app_minimal.py` - a simple Flask app that should deploy successfully.

### 📋 **Current Configuration**
- **Test App**: `app_minimal.py` (simple, no external dependencies)
- **Procfile**: `web: gunicorn app_minimal:app`
- **Requirements**: Latest stable versions
- **Status**: Pushed to GitHub, ready for Render deployment

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

### **Option 1: Deploy Minimal App First**
1. Go to [Render.com](https://render.com)
2. Create new Web Service
3. Connect to your GitHub repository
4. Deploy with current settings
5. **Expected URL**: `https://pulse-financial-app.onrender.com`

### **Option 2: Once Minimal App Works**
After the minimal app deploys successfully, I'll:
1. Switch back to the full `app_monochrome.py`
2. Fix any remaining issues
3. Deploy the complete PULSE Financial Platform
